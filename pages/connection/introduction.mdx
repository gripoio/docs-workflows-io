#### Connections

Connections in <b>GRiPO</b> help you store and manage credentials safely in one place. They let your workflows easily connect with different platforms like <b>Azure, Slack, AWS, and OpenAI </b> without putting sensitive information directly inside the workflow. Once created, the same connection can be used in multiple workflows, making integration simple and secure.

By using connections, teams can standardize integrations, enhance security, and reduce configuration errors. Credentials are managed in one place, making it easy to update tokens or keys without editing each individual <b>workflow.</b>

In GRiPO, connections ensure smooth communication between workflows and external services, enabling actions such as deploying applications, sending notifications, triggering APIs, or accessing <b>cloud resources.</b> This centralized approach provides better visibility, consistency, and reliability across all connected environments, supporting efficient and secure automation at scale.
