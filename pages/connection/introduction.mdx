#### Connections

Connections in GRiPO provide a secure and centralized way to manage <b>credentials </b>for external services, enabling seamless integration between workflows and various platforms such as Azure, Slack, AWS, OpenAI, and more. Instead of embedding sensitive information directly into workflows, connections store credentials safely and allow multiple workflows to use them without duplication.

By using connections, teams can standardize integrations, enhance security, and reduce configuration errors. Credentials are managed in one place, making it easy to update tokens or keys without editing each individual <b>workflow.</b>

In GRiPO, connections ensure smooth communication between workflows and external services, enabling actions such as deploying applications, sending notifications, triggering APIs, or accessing <b>cloud resources.</b> This centralized approach provides better visibility, consistency, and reliability across all connected environments, supporting efficient and secure automation at scale.
