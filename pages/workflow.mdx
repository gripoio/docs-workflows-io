#### Workflows
Workflows in GRiPO automate repetitive and complex processes across multiple environments, enabling teams to focus on strategy rather than manual execution. Each workflow defines a clear sequence of steps, including triggers, actions, and conditions, that determine how and when tasks are executed.

By using workflows, teams can standardize operations, reduce human error, and ensure consistent performance across every environment — from development and testing to production.

In GRiPO, workflows offer end-to-end visibility and centralized control, allowing you to monitor progress, manage dependencies, and troubleshoot issues in real time. Whether it’s deploying applications, handling incidents, optimizing costs, or performing security checks, GRiPO ensures that every process runs efficiently, reliably, and in perfect coordination across teams and systems.
