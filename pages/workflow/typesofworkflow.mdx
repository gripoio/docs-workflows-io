### Types of Workflows in GRiPO

GRiPO offers different types of workflows to match your automation needs. Each type helps you manage tasks more efficiently and ensures smooth operations across teams and systems.

#### <b> [On Demand Workflow](/workflow/typesofworkflow/ondemand)</b> :

* These workflows run only when you manually start them.
* They’re useful for tasks that you don’t need to run automatically — like testing, ad-hoc analysis, or one-time operations.

<b>How GRiPO helps:</b> With just one click, you can trigger and monitor your On Demand workflows directly from the GRiPO dashboard, giving you full control over when and how they run.

#### <b> [On Schedule Workflow](/workflow/typesofworkflow/onschdule)</b> :

* These workflows run automatically at specific times or intervals — daily, weekly, or at any custom schedule.
* Ideal for regular tasks such as backups, reports, or routine checks.

<b>How GRiPO helps:</b> GRiPO’s scheduler ensures your workflows run on time, every time — with automated logging, tracking, and alerts for complete visibility.

#### <b> [Webhook Workflow](/workflow/typesofworkflow/webhook)</b> :

* These workflows start automatically when a certain event happens, such as receiving a request from another system or service.
* Great for real-time automation like CI/CD triggers, incident alerts, or external API events.

<b>How GRiPO helps:</b> GRiPO securely handles webhook triggers and ensures instant execution, helping you build responsive and connected systems.

#### <b> [WhatsApp Workflow](/workflow/typesofworkflow/whatapps)</b> 

* These workflows are triggered by messages received through WhatsApp.
* Useful for quickly performing actions or checking system updates using simple WhatsApp commands.

<b>How GRiPO helps:</b> GRiPO connects WhatsApp with your operations, allowing you to trigger workflows, check system health, or get alerts instantly .
