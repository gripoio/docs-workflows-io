#### On Demand Workflow

<b>When to Use:</b>
Use an On-Demand Workflow when you want to run a process manually whenever you need it.
It’s best for one-time actions, testing, or checking something quickly without setting up any schedule or trigger.
You’re fully in control — the workflow only runs when you start it.

<b>Examples:</b>

* Run a workflow manually to check the health of your cluster after making updates.
* Redeploy an application on demand when a new version is ready.
* Generate a quick cost report before closing your billing cycle.
