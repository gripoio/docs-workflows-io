#### On Schdule Workflow

<b>When to Use:</b>
Choose an On-Schedule Workflow when you want your process to<b> run automatically at a set time or repeat regularly.</b>
Itâ€™s ideal for daily, weekly, or monthly tasks that should happen on their own without anyone needing to start them.

<b>Examples:</b>

* Run a workflow every morning to collect and email system or cost reports.
* Shut down inactive clusters automatically every night to save cloud costs.
* Send a weekly summary on Slack showing deployments and alerts.
