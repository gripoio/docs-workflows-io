#### Webhook Workflow

<b>When to Use:</b>
Select a Webhook Workflow when you want GRiPO to start a workflow <b>automatically after an event happens in another system.</b>
This is useful when you want real-time responses or automatic actions between tools.

<b>Examples:</b>

* When a new issue appears in your monitoring tool, GRiPO automatically restarts the affected service.
* When a ticket is created in Jira, GRiPO sends an alert to Slack.
* When a GitHub commit is pushed, GRiPO starts a deployment workflow automatically.
