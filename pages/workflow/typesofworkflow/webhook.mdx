#### Webhook Workflow

<b>When to Use:</b>
Select a Webhook Workflow when you want GRiPO to start a workflow <b>automatically after an event happens in another system.</b>
This is useful when you want real-time responses or automatic actions between tools.

<b>Examples:</b>

* When a new issue appears in your monitoring tool, GRiPO automatically restarts the affected service.
* When a ticket is created in Jira, GRiPO sends an alert to Slack.
* When a GitHub commit is pushed, GRiPO starts a deployment workflow automatically.

#### Create Webhook Type Workflow

* Navigate to the Workflow tab from the main menu.
<br />
![workflow](/main1.png)<br  />
* On clicking Workflow, a window will appear displaying a list of all existing workflows.
* To create a new workflow, click on the<b> Create Workflow</b> button.
<br />
![workflow](/workflow/workflow0.png)<br  />

* A form will appear containing the following fields:

<b>Name</b> : Enter a unique name for your workflow.<br  />
<b>Description</b> : Add a short explanation of what the workflow does.<br  />
<b>Type</b> : Select the workflow type "Webhook" from the available options.<br  />
<b>Retry</b> : Define how many times a failed step should be retried.<br  />
<b>Tags </b>: Add relevant tags to help categorize and filter workflows.<br  />

* After selecting “Webhook” as the workflow type, a form appears with several configuration fields.
* Fill the following details:

<b>Path: Define the API path for your webhook.</b>
<br  />
<b>Method: Choose the HTTP method</b>

 Choose one of the following HTTP methods based on the action you want to perform:
* <b>POST:</b> Used to send new data to a server or application. Example: sending form data or creating a new record.
* <b>GET:</b> Used to retrieve existing data from a server. Example: fetching details of a cluster or user.
* <b>PUT:</b> Used to update existing data completely. Example: replacing an old configuration with a new one.
* <b>PATCH: </b>Used to update data partially, changing only specific fields. Example: updating the status of a node without altering other details.
* <b>DELETE:</b> Used to remove or delete data from the server. Example: deleting an unused resource or record.

<b>The Type option defines how and when your webhook workflow should run after being triggered. GRiPO offers three types:</b>
* <b>Immediately:</b> The workflow starts as soon as the webhook is triggered, without waiting for any additional input or response. Ideal for quick, automated actions.
Example: Restarting a service instantly when an alert is received.
* <b>Select Activity:</b> The webhook triggers a specific activity within the workflow instead of running the entire workflow. Useful when you only want to perform one defined action.
Example: Updating cost data or sending a notification without executing all steps.
* <b>Webhook Response: </b>The webhook waits for a response before continuing to the next step in the workflow. This is best for integrations that require confirmation or data exchange.
Example: Waiting for an API to return success or failure before moving ahead.

<b>"Enabled" option lets you control whether your webhook is active or inactive.</b>

* <b>Active: </b>The webhook is live and ready to receive or send data when triggered.
* <b>Inactive:</b> The webhook is disabled and will not respond until reactivated.
<br />

<b>"Is Public "option defines whether your webhook can be accessed publicly or kept private.</b>
* <b>True:</b> The webhook is publicly accessible, meaning external systems can trigger it without authentication (use with caution).
* <b>False:</b> The webhook is private and secure, allowing access only through authorized connections.
<br />

<b> If you want to include additional settings, click on the “Add” option.</b>

<b>When you click on the “Add” option, a list of extra configuration fields appears. These settings help you control access, security, and performance of your webhook.</b>

* <b>IP Whitelist:</b>Define specific IP addresses that are allowed to access the webhook. This adds an extra layer of security by blocking unauthorized sources.
* <b>Authorization:</b>Set authentication credentials (like tokens or keys) required to access the webhook, ensuring only trusted systems can trigger it.
* <b>Allow Content Type:</b>Specify which data formats (e.g., JSON, XML, or form data) the webhook will accept from incoming requests.
* <b>Field Count Limit:</b>Limit the maximum number of data fields allowed in a webhook request to prevent oversized or complex payloads.
* <b>JSON Depth Limit:</b>Set how deeply nested JSON objects can be in a request — this helps protect against overly complex or malicious payloads.
* <b>Max Payload Size (Bytes):</b>Define the largest request size (in bytes) that the webhook can handle, ensuring system stability and performance.
* <b>Max Requests Per Minute:</b>Control how many requests the webhook can receive per minute to prevent overloading or misuse.
