#### Whatsapp Workflow

<b>When to Use:</b>
Choose a WhatsApp Workflow if you want to control or check your workflows directly from WhatsApp.
It’s perfect for getting quick updates, triggering workflows, or receiving alerts without logging in to GRiPO.

<b>Examples:</b>

* Send “Check Cluster Health” on WhatsApp to get the latest status of your cluster.
* Type “Stop AWS/EKS Cluster” to pause a cluster right from your phone.
* Get instant WhatsApp alerts whenever a workflow completes, fails, or needs attention.
