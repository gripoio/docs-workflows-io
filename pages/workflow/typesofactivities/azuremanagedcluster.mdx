#### <b>Overview:</b>
The Azure Managed Kubernetess activity helps automate the management of your Azure clusters. You can start, stop, or restart resources directly from GRiPO workflows. This ensures smoother operations, reduced downtime, and better control of your Azure environment.

<b>Examples:</b>

* Start clusters before deployment automatically.
* Restart nodes when a failure is detected.
* Stop clusters during off-hours to save resources.
