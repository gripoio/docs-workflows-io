#### <b>Overview:</b>
The Amazon Managed Kubernetes activity in GRiPO helps you easily automate and manage your AWS clusters. It allows you to start, stop, scale, or monitor your cluster resources directly through workflows. This makes daily operations faster, reduces manual work, and ensures your cloud resources are always optimized.

<b>Examples:</b>
* Start or stop EC2 nodes automatically.
* Restart clusters when they become unhealthy.
* Scale resources based on workload or schedule.
