#### Overview:
Core activities are the foundation of any GRiPO workflow. They help control how your workflow runs using logic-based actions like If/Else, Loop, Switch, Parallel Path, and Webhook Event Response. These tools make workflows smarter and more flexible.

Examples:

* Use [If/Else](/workflow/typesofactivities/core/iforelse) to perform actions based on specific conditions.
* Run multiple steps together with [Parallel Path](/workflow/typesofactivities/core/parallelpath).
* Trigger another workflow using [Run External Workflow](/workflow/typesofactivities/core/runexternalworkflow).
* Repeat actions for each item using [Loop](/workflow/typesofactivities/core/loop) (e.g., process all nodes in a cluster one by one).
* Pause or stop a specific process with [Stop Current Cluster](/workflow/typesofactivities/core/stopcurrentworkflow) during maintenance or updates.
* Store and reuse data in the next steps using [Temporary Save](/workflow/typesofactivities/core/temporarysave) (like saving cluster or node details).
* Handle incoming API triggers or responses using [Webhook Event Response](/workflow/typesofactivities/core/webhookeventresponse) to automate based on external events.
* [Switch](/workflow/typesofactivities/core/switch) on alert severity â€” send a Slack message for Warning and trigger a workflow for Critical.
