#### <b>Overview:</b>
Core activities are the foundation of any GRiPO workflow. They help control how your workflow runs using logic-based actions like If/Else, Loop, Switch, Parallel Path, and Webhook Event Response. These tools make workflows smarter and more flexible.

<b>Examples:</b>

* Use If/Else to perform actions based on specific conditions.
* Run multiple steps together with Parallel Path.
* Trigger another workflow using Run External Workflow.
